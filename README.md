# WHATLYRIC

This project was generated with the [Angular Full-Stack Generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) version 3.0.0-rc7-patch.0.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js and NPM](nodejs.org) >= v0.12.0
- [Bower](bower.io) (`npm install --global bower`)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) and then `gem install sass`
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) (`npm install --global grunt-cli`)

### Usage

This is pretty straight forward. Use the app locally by following the steps below and visiting http://localhost:9000, or see it online at [WhatLyric](http://whatlyric.rhcloud.com). You can actually do sort of a search from the lyrics page, via the browser's address bar. E.g., http://localhost:9000/lyrics/paul-simon/the-cool-cool-river or, if you're visiting the app on the staging server, http://whatlyric.rhcloud.com/lyrics/billy-joel/and-so-it-goes (you can replace the hyphens with spaces and it will function just the same).

### Developing

1. Run `npm install` to install server dependencies.

2. Run `bower install` to install front-end dependencies.

4. Run `grunt serve` to start the development server. It should automatically open the client in your browser when ready.

## Build & development

Run `grunt build` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.
